        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          Note 1: While coding the regular react component consumed less time,
          it required juggling two booleans to make them fit all the
          requirements. Without following TDD , it felt I was hacking guard
          flags until I had found the right combination. Many times doubting
          whether I needed a third boolean to cover certain state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note 2: Designing the transitions in the Viz tool forced me to think
          many more scenarios than I would have thought otherwise. TDD usually
          covers some of these but with a visual tool allowing me to test the
          flows, I believe it actually helped me cover more scenarios. Having
          done this first, it was easier to know all the scenarios I need to
          fulffil on both React+Xstate or React alone.
        </p>

          Note 3: The diagram became my user story/requirements. This could be a
          great source for discussions between a product owner, a QA and a dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note 4: in Xstate when the state did not have further transitions, the
          button simply would not change. On the React version, this required me
          removing the onClick after manually testing out I had missed an
          scenario
        </p>
        <p>
          Note 5: While Xstate version seems to carry out more coding and plenty
          of designing, I can see how fragile my hand react only coding could be
          compared to the state/transitions definition done in the state machine
        </p>
        <p>
          Note 6: in Xstate I had defined certain states I ended up ignoring
          such as hover and focus. CSS already has its own state machine and
          defines those states for me.
